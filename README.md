# ZeroCostDL4Mic_VirtualMultiplexing

## Overview

This repository contains the code as well as the tool generated for the project 'User-friendly deep learning-based morphometric unmixing of multiplex 3D imaging data'. 

It contains: 

* ZeroCostDL4Mic-VirtualMultiplexing. 
* Code to generate training and testing data from CZI format image dataset. 
* Deep Learning training and test examples. 

ZeroCostDL4Mic-VirtualMultiplexing is a tool for generate and use deep learning models for signal unmixing in fluorescent microscopy imaging. It is set in a user friendly interface so anyone can use it, for that it is implemented in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). 

For the Deep Learning approach used for virtual multiplexing embebed in ZeroCostDL4Mic-VirtualMultiplexing is based on [pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix).
